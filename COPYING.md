Note that the GNU **Affero** GPL has additional terms over the standard GNU GPL for operating it over network infrastructure.

This program incorporates Expat licensed code. You must agree to [the Expat license](./COPYING.MIT) to distribute those portions. The Expat requirements are a subset of the GNU AGPL requirements, so by abiding by the AGPL terms, you are abiding by the Expat terms as well.

# Other Notes
## Source Code
Downloads are served from the [github repository](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic). Github automatically includes zip and tar.gz archives of the source at the time of the release. Additionally, you can clone the repo to get the latest code.

Modules are gotten by running `yarn install` inside the project folder.

## SPDX Identifiers
The SPDX identifiers provide programatic identification of licenses. They are not copyright notices, and do not have to be preserved either verbatim or "in spirit". They should be modified to be kept up to date with the most relevant information. Identifiers do not modify, supersede, or supplant the license text. Parsing an SPDX identifier is not a replacement for reading the license. Removing an identifier does not modify the copyright of the work and does not absolve you of your responsibility to abide by the license terms. For more information on this matter, see the "Copyright notices" section of [the SPDX page on handling license info](https://spdx.dev/learn/handling-license-info/).

## Other Files
Non-code files have their own copyrights and trademarks. If you modify Frolic and distribute those modifications, you must remove instances of the word "Frolic" that appear when running the app, such as those in the main application window and in the tray menu. Additionally, you must remove all logos. The logos include: the "Four Friends" logo - a circular image consisting of four flower petals in a ring, each of their own distinct shape and color, sometimes surrounded with an outline, typically white or black; the "Flower Outline" images which are images exclusively of the outline of the Four Friends without the internal color; the "Petal" images - each Petal a version of the Four Friends that contains only a single Friend; the "Bloom" alert - which is the Four Friends logo but with a large, colored circle at the center; and the "Sun Flower" - which is the Bloom logo with an additional sunburst shape set behind the Petals and the center circle. There may be additional variants of the logos, which you should also remove.
