## 💾 Downloads
The latest release is **0.8.3**. You can download it [on the release page](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/releases/tag/0.8.3). Our sub-1.0 release number indicates that core features we'd like to deliver are still undergoing major development, even though the application is stable and reliable.

<small>While Frolic doesn't mess with your logs, it's always wise to backup important files before installing or upgrading software. Your logs from the vanilla F-Chat desktop client and from F-Chat Rising are located at `%appdata%\fchat\data` on Windows and in `~/.config/fchat/data` on Linux. Frolic continues to use this location so you can continue your conversations right where you left off.</small>


# 🌺 Come Frolic!
Frolic is an F-Chat client developed for simplicity and stability. It's based on the feature set of the legacy client Rising with a focus on smoothing down the rough edges and providing obvious, non-intrusive improvements to having a positive experience when chatting with others.

I am a technical-minded person, so the improvements will be focused on usability and performance, but guided by comfort. What I want most from my F-Chat experience is a homely and familiar place to settle into, chat with my friends, and make new ones. And that's what I'm making Folic to be - no shocks or surprises, no complicated UI - just a predicatable place that lets me have fun with my friends.

Frolic re-uses the default fchat settings and directory so it's easy to pick up where you left off - whether you're coming from the official app or updating from Rising. That level of reliability is important, and is a staple of Frolic's design ethos. Similiarly, there will be no grant UI overhaul - just simple tweaks here and there to make the application easier to manage.

Frolic is not shiny - deliberately so. We do not ship weekly updates with questionable features. Most of Frolic's updates are behind the scenes - fixing unusual bugs or performance issues that have plagued its codebase for years. However, new features are always a possibility if they mesh with Frolic's design goals of enhancing interactivity with other chat members. If you feel something is missing that would fit Frolic, please request it on our issue tracker.

**Frolic** is an extended version of the now-defunct F-Chat Rising which itself was an extended version of the [original F-Chat 3.0 client](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0). You'll connect with the same F-List, same players, and same channels you're already used to, but with advanced features and quality of life improvements.

There may be some residual features from Rising that do not fit well with Frolic's design goals. These features will be adjusted over time, so please provide feedback on any changes to features you love.

For help installing, refer to the [original installation instructions](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0/Installation).
