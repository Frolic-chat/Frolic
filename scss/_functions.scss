/*
 * This section is a response to the upcoming removal of lighten() and darken().
 * It's quite complicated to remove these functions even with color.adjust()
 * being a direct upgrade, due to this notice in the code that revealed:
 * On dark based themes these are inverted in order to cooperate with
 * bootstrap which assumes that all themes are light based.
 *
 * This means lighten() and darken() in some themes does the opposite, due
 * to an overload in _invert. It needs a refactor once bootstrap actually
 * updates to use sass `@use` modules. Then, we can change hue/sat/light/a below,
 * into color.channel()
