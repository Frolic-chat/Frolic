# Installing Frolic on MacOS

> ### Warning!
>
> Frolic has chosen to discontinue the macOS version
> due to the inability to compile and test the application,
> as well as the need for a security certificate from Apple.
> Running it on MacOS requires you to disable security
> protections that are in place for a good reason:
> Unsigned applications are a common way to distribute malware.
> 
> Consider these alternatives to increase your safety:
> 
> 1) Compile Frolic yourself from the [source](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic); or
>
> 2) Run Frolic in a [virtual machine](https://www.parallels.com/); or
> 
> 3) ~~Donate a code signing certificate, so we can sign the client.~~
> That's a very expensive solution for such an indie application.
