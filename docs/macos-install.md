# Installing F-Chat Rising on MacOS

> ### Warning!
>
> F-Chat Risinger has chosen to discontinue the macOS version
> due to the inability to compile and test the application,
> as well as the need for a security certificate from Apple.
> Running it on MacOS requires you to disable security
> protections that are in place for a good reason:
> Unsigned applications are a common way to distribute malware.
> 
> Consider these alternatives to increase your safety:
> 
> 1) Compile F-Chat Risinger yourself from the [source](https://github.com/FireUnderTheMountain/fchat-risinger); or
>
> 2) Run F-Chat Risinger in a [virtual machine](https://www.parallels.com/); or
> 
> 3) ~~Donate a code signing certificate, so we can sign the client.~~
> That's a very expensive solution for such an indie application.
