**F-Chat Risinger** is an unnamed, extended version of the now-defunct F-Chat Rising which itself was an extended version of the [original F-Chat 3.0 client](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0). It adds new features, bug fixes, and usability improvements. The goal is to maintain the existing feature set with mild touch-ups and bug fixes.

You'll connect with the same F-List, same players, and same channels you're already used to.
You'll just do it with style!
